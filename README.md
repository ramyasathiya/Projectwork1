## Title of the Project

Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images using GAN-based Anomaly Detection

## Small Description

The project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection approach, aimed at assisting early diagnosis and improving medical decision-making accuracy.

## About

Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images using GAN-based Anomaly Detection is a deep learning–based medical imaging project designed to identify abnormal tumor regions in brain MRI scans. Traditional tumor detection methods require extensive labeled datasets and manual interpretation by radiologists, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

This project utilizes GANs trained on normal MRI images to learn healthy brain patterns. Any deviation from this learned distribution is treated as an anomaly, enabling effective tumor detection even with limited labeled tumor data. The system improves diagnostic efficiency and supports clinicians in early and accurate tumor identification.
